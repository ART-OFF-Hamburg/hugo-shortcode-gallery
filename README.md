# hugo-shortcode-gallery

This is a theme component for hugo. 

This component contains a shortcode to include a gallery in your .md files.

The gallery is rendered using autogenerated thumbnails arranged in a 
[grid](http://miromannino.github.io/Justified-Gallery/). With a click on the images 
a [lightbox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/) is opend an all images can be 
viewed fullscreen.

## Installation

Clone this git repository into your *themes* folder. 

```
git clone https://github.com/mfg92/hugo-shortcode-gallery.git
```

Next edit your projects 
*config.toml* and add this theme component to your themes:

```
theme = ["your-main-theme", "hugo-shortcode-gallery"]
```

To read about hugos theme components and how to use them have a look at 
https://gohugo.io/themes/theme-components/.


## Usage Example

Here is an usage example:

```
{{< gallery match="images/*" rowHeight="150" margins="5" resizeOptions="x300 q90 Lanczos" >}}
```

This will generate a gallery containing all images of the folder *images*.
The folder must be next to the .md file where this gallery is used in.

The `rowHeight` paramter determines the height of the rows that are displayed while the 
`margin` paramter defines the gap between the images.

A thumbnail is generated using the `resizeOptions` paramter, they are handed over 
to *Hugos* [image processing](https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/) 
function. In the example above the generated thumbnails have a width of 300 pixel and 
a height depending on the original aspect ratio. The JPEG image quality is 90% and the 
scaling uses the high quality *Lanczos* filter.

As many websites/themes already include *jQuery*, this theme component will use the available *jQuery* lib.
If the page does not already use *jQuery* the paramter `loadJQuery=true` must be used to 
instruct the theme component to load the provided *jQuery* lib.

## Requirements

This component requieres a hugo version >= 0.48.

## Dependencies

The component uses (and includes) [*Justified Gallery*](http://miromannino.github.io/Justified-Gallery/)
to render the images between the text and [*Swipebox*](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/)
to show them fullscreen.
